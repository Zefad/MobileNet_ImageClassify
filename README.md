# Image Classification Tool

This project implements a simple image classification tool using Python, TensorFlow, and the pre-trained `MobileNet` model. The tool takes an image as input, classifies it into one of the 1,000 ImageNet categories, and displays the top two predictions along with their confidence scores.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images using the pre-trained MobileNet model.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to input an image path and view the image along with predictions.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Uses MobileNet for fast and accurate classification.

## Installation

To use this tool, you need to install the required Python libraries. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zefad/MobileNet_ImageClassify.git
   cd MobileNet_ImageClassify
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

### Running the Tool
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Image_Classify.ipynb`.
2. Run each cell.
3. Add image path as Input.
